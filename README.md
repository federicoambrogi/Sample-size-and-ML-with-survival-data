# Sample-size-and-ML-with-survival-data
Code for the article "Sample size and predictive performance of Machine Learning methods with survival data"

This code provide functions that were used in simulations for the paper "Sample size and predictive performance of Machine Learning methods with survival data". 
The function "sim_run" estimate the different models used in the work.
The true simulation was run fitting separately the different models considered the amount of time required.
Simulations were run in parallel using HPC and computational resources were provided by INDACO Platform, 
which is a project of High Performance Computing at the University of Milan (https://www.indaco.unimi.it/)
